## Introduction

The `jupyter_rfb` library provides a widget (an `ipywidgets` subclass)
that can be used in the Jupyter notebook and in JupyterLab to implement
a remote frame-buffer.

Images that are generated at the server are streamed to the client
(Jupyter) where they are shown. Events (such as mouse interactions) are
streamed in the other direction, where the server can react by
generating new images.

This *remote-frame-buffer* approach can be an effective method for
server-generated visualizations to be dispayed in Jupyter notebook/lab. For
example visualization created by tools like vispy, datoviz or pygfx.


## Scope

The above defines the full scope of this library; it's a base widget
that other libraries can extend for different purposes. Consequently,
these libraries don't have to each invent a Jupyter widget, and in
*this* library we can focus on doing that one task really well.


## Installation

To install use pip:

    $ pip install jupyter_rfb

On older versions of Jupyter notebook/lab an extra step might be needed
to enable the widget.

To install into an existing conda environment:

    $ conda install -c conda-forge jupyter-rfb


## Development installation

For a development installation (requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [Yarn version 1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/)),

    $ git clone https://github.com/vispy/jupyter_rfb.git
    $ cd jupyter_rfb
    $ pip install -e .
    $ jupyter nbextension install --py --symlink --overwrite --sys-prefix jupyter_rfb
    $ jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix jupyter_rfb

When actively developing your extension for JupyterLab, run the command:

    $ jupyter labextension develop --overwrite jupyter_rfb

Then you need to rebuild the JS when you make a code change:

    $ cd js
    $ yarn run build

You then need to refresh the JupyterLab page when your javascript changes.


## Developer notes

To install developer tools:

    $ pip install pytest black flake8 flake8-docstrings flake8-bugbear

The code is autoformatted with `black .` and linted with `flake8 .`. There is
a `release.py` to make the release process easy.

Optionally, you can setup an autocommit hook to automatically run these on each commit:
```
$ pip install pre-commit
$ pre-commit install
```
